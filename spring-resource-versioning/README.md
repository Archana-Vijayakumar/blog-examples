Spark web API example
=============
Example project for my Blog post [Resource versioning with Spring MVC][1].

To run the application you only have to run the `main()` method in `MvcApplication`. Spring boot will then start an embedded Tomcat. You can access the running application at `http://localhost:8080`.
